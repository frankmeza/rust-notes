# Treating Smart Pointers Like Regular References with the Deref Trait

By implementing `Deref`, you can:

- customize the behavior of the dereference operator, `*` (as opposed to the multiplication or glob operator). 
- implement `Deref` so a smart pointer can be treated like a regular reference, you can write code that operates on references and use that code with smart pointers too.

wut??

- first see how the dereference operator works with regular references
- then we define a custom type that behaves like Box<T>, and see why the deref operator doesnâ€™t work like a reference on our newly defined type
- then see how implementing the `Deref` trait makes it possible for smart pointers to work in ways similar to references. 
- Then weâ€™ll look at Rustâ€™s deref coercion feature and how it lets us work with either references or smart pointers.

Note: thereâ€™s one big difference between the `MyBox<T>` type weâ€™re about to build and the real `Box<T>`: our version will not store its data on the heap. We are focusing this example on `Deref`, so where the data is actually stored is less important than the pointer-like behavior.

## Following the Pointer to the Value with the Dereference Operator

A regular reference is a type of pointer, think of a pointer is as an arrow to a value stored somewhere else. 

```rust
fn main() {
    // make a ref to an i32 value,
    let x = 5;
    let y = &x;

    assert_eq!(5, x);
    // and then use the dereference operator (*) to follow the reference to the data
    assert_eq!(5, *y);
}
```

- `x` holds i32 value, `5`
- We set `y` equal to a reference to `x`. We can assert that `x` is equal to `5`. 
- to make an assertion about the value in `y`, we have to use `*y` to follow the reference to the value itâ€™s pointing to (hence dereference). Once we dereference `y`, we have access to the integer value y is pointing to that we can compare with `5`.

`assert_eq!(5, y);` instead returns this compilation error:

```
error[E0277]: can't compare `{integer}` with `&{integer}`
 --> src/main.rs:6:5
  |
6 |     assert_eq!(5, y);
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ no implementation for `{integer} == &{integer}`
  |
  = help: the trait `std::cmp::PartialEq<&{integer}>` is not implemented for
  `{integer}`
```

Comparing a number and a reference to a number isnâ€™t allowed because theyâ€™re different types. We must use the dereference operator to follow the reference to the value itâ€™s pointing to.

## Using Box<T> Like a Reference

We can rewrite the code above to use a Box<T> instead of a reference;
```rust
// dereferencing a Box<T>
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = Box::new(x); // instead of let y = &x;

    assert_eq!(5, x);
    assert_eq!(5, *y);
}
```

- The only difference is that we use a box pointing to the value in `x` rather than a reference pointing to the value of `x`
- we can use the dereference operator to follow the boxâ€™s pointer in the same way that we did when `y` was a reference. Next, weâ€™ll explore what is special about `Box<T>` that enables us to use the dereference operator by defining our own box type.

## Defining Our Own Smart Pointer

> Letâ€™s build a smart pointer similar to the Box<T> type provided by the standard library to experience how smart pointers behave differently from references by default. Then weâ€™ll look at how to add the ability to use the dereference operator.

The `Box<T>` type:
- is defined as a tuple struct with one element, and needs the new function defined on Box<T>.

```rust
struct MyBox<T>(T);

impl<T> MyBox<T> {
    fn new(x: T) -> MyBox<T> {
        MyBox(x)
    }
}
```

We define a `struct` named `MyBox` and declare a generic parameter `T` so our type can hold values of any type

- the MyBox type is a tuple struct with one element of type T. 
- `The MyBox::new` function takes one parameter of type `T` and returns a `MyBox` instance that holds the value passed in.

-- `This is all kind of like middleware for a single variable...` --

Letâ€™s use the `MyBox<T>` type weâ€™ve defined instead of `Box<T>`

- The code in Listing 15-9 wonâ€™t compile because Rust doesnâ€™t know how to dereference `MyBox`


```rust
fn main() {
    // attempting to use MyBox<T> in the same way we used references and Box<T>: FAIL
    let x = 5;
    let y = MyBox::new(x);

    assert_eq!(5, x);
    assert_eq!(5, *y);
}
```

WHY?? Hereâ€™s the resulting compilation error:

```
error[E0614]: type `MyBox<{integer}>` cannot be dereferenced
  --> src/main.rs:14:19
   |
14 |     assert_eq!(5, *y);
   |                   ^^
```

Our `MyBox<T>` type canâ€™t be dereferenced because we havenâ€™t implemented that ability on our type.  

- to enable dereferencing with the * operator, we implement the `Deref` trait

## Treating a Type Like a Reference by Implementing the Deref Trait

- to implement a trait, provide implementations for the traitâ€™s required methods
- The `Deref` trait from the standard library, requires us to implement one method named `deref` that 
  - borrows self,
  - and returns a reference to the inner data

```rust
// add import statement for trait to be linked to, for this struct
use std::ops::Deref;

impl<T> Deref for MyBox<T> {
    type Target = T;

    // - borrows self,
    // - and returns a reference to the inner data
    fn deref(&self) -> &T {
        &self.0
    }
}
```

`type Target = T;` 

- defines an associated type for the `Deref` trait to use
- associated types are a different way of declaring a generic parameter, to be covered later
- fill in the body of the `deref` method with `&self.0` so `deref` returns a reference to the value we want to access with the `*` operator
- the `main` function above that calls `*` on the `MyBox<T>` value compiles now
- without the `Deref ` trait, the compiler can only dereference `&` references
- the `deref `method gives the compiler the ability to:
  - take a value of any type that implements `Deref `,
  - then call the `deref `method to get a `&` reference that it knows how to dereference.

Behind the scenes Rust actually ran this code:

```rust
*(y.deref())
```

Rust substitutes the `*` operator with a call to the `deref` method and then a plain dereference so we donâ€™t have to think about whether or not we need to call the `deref` method. This Rust feature lets us write code that functions identically whether we have a regular reference or a type that implements `Deref`.

`You can in many cases just write '*y'`

The reason the `deref` method returns a reference to a value, and that the plain dereference outside the parentheses in `*(y.deref())` is still necessary, is the ownership system. 

wut??

If the `deref` method returned the value directly instead of a reference to the value, the value would be moved out of self. We donâ€™t want to take ownership of the inner value inside `MyBox<T>` in this case or in most cases where we use the dereference operator.

Note that the `*` operator is replaced with a call to the `deref` method and then a call to the `*` operator just once, each time we use a `*` in our code.  

Because the substitution of the `*` operator does not recurse infinitely, we end up with data of type i32, as wanted.

### Implicit Deref Coercions with Functions and Methods

`Deref` coercion 

- a convenience that Rust performs on arguments to functions and methods
- converts a reference to a type that implements `Deref` into a reference to a type that `Deref` can convert the original type into
- happens automatically when we 
  - pass a reference as an argument to a function or method that doesnâ€™t match the parameter type in the function or method definition. A sequence of calls to the `deref` method converts the type we provided into the type the parameter needs. __wut??__
- was added to Rust so that programmers writing function and method calls donâ€™t need to add as many explicit references and dereferences with `&` and `*`. 
- __also lets us write more code that can work for either references or smart pointers__

To see `deref` coercion in action, letâ€™s use the `MyBox<T>` type defined earlier as well as the implementation of `Deref` that we saw too.  

a function that has a string slice parameter:

```rust
fn hello(name: &str) {
    println!("Hello, {}!", name);
}
```

You can call the `hello` function with a string slice as an argument, such as `hello("Rust");` for example. `Deref` coercion makes it possible to call hello with a reference to a value of type `MyBox<`String`>`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let m = MyBox::new(String::from("Rust"));
    // m is a reference to MyBox<String>
    hello(&m);
}
```

- calling the hello function with the argument `&m`, which is a reference to a `MyBox<String>` value.
- We have the `Deref` trait on `MyBox<T>`, Rust turns `&MyBox<String>` into `&String` by calling `deref`.
- haHAA! __standard lib has an implementation of `Deref` on `String` that returns a string slice, and this is in the API documentation for `Deref`. Rust calls `deref` again to turn the `&String` into `&str`, which matches the hello functionâ€™s definition.__

Without `deref` coercion, the code to call hello with a value of type `&MyBox<String>` would be:

```rust
fn main() {
    let m = MyBox::new(String::from("Rust"));
    hello(&(*m)[..]); // instead of hello(&m); ðŸ˜±

    // hello(
    //     &(
    //         (*m) 1. deref MyBox<String> into String
    //         [..] 2. creates str (not &str) from whole range of String
    //     )        3. eval &() with its arg, evals -> &str
    // )            4. eval hello() with its arg, evals -> compiles, runs println! 
}
```

1. the `(*m)` dereferences the `MyBox<String>` into a `String`.
2. Then the `&` and `[..]` take a string slice of the `String` that is equal to the whole string to match the signature of `hello`. 

The code without deref coercions is harder to read, write, and understand.

`Deref` coercion allows Rust to handle these conversions for us automatically.

When the `Deref` trait is defined for the types involved, Rust will analyze the types and use `Deref::deref` as many times as necessary to get a reference to match the parameterâ€™s type. The number of times that `Deref::deref` needs to be inserted is resolved at compile time, so there is no runtime penalty for taking advantage of deref coercion!

## How Deref Coercion Interacts with Mutability

Similar to how you use the `Deref` trait to override the `*` operator on immutable references, you can use the `DerefMut` trait to override the `*` operator on mutable references.

### Rust does deref coercion when it finds types and trait implementations in three cases:

1. From `&T` to `&U` when `T: Deref<Target=U>` // ie when impl `Deref`
2. From `&mut T` to `&mut U` when `T: DerefMut<Target=U>`
3. From `&mut T` to `&U` when `T: Deref<Target=U>` // similar to case 1, but mut to immut

The first two cases are the same except for mutability.  

The first case states that 

- if you have a `&T`,
- and `T` implements `Deref` to some type `U`, you can get a `&U` transparently. 

The second case states that the same deref coercion happens for mutable references.

The third case is trickier:

- Rust coerces a mutable reference to an immutable one. 
- But the reverse is not possible: immutable references will never coerce to mutable references. 

Because of the borrowing rules,

1. if you have a mutable reference, that mutable reference must be the only reference to that data (otherwise, the program wouldnâ€™t compile). // like case 2?
2. Converting one mutable reference to one immutable reference will never break the borrowing rules. // like case 3?
3. Converting an immutable reference to a mutable reference would require that there is only one immutable reference to that data, and the borrowing rules donâ€™t guarantee that. Therefore, Rust canâ€™t make the assumption that converting an immutable reference to a mutable reference is possible.
