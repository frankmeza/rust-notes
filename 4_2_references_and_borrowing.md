# References and Borrowing

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    // here, calculate_length is only using &s1
    // as a reference to assign a value to `len`
    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len() // a reference to a pointer to data on the heap
} // Here, s goes out of scope. But because it does not have ownership of what
  // it refers to, nothing happens.
```

> The scope in which the variable `s` is valid is the same as any function parameterâ€™s scope, but we donâ€™t drop what the reference points to when it goes out of scope because we donâ€™t have ownership. When functions have references as parameters instead of the actual values, we wonâ€™t need to return the values in order to give back ownership, because we never had ownership.

- `&String` is a reference to a pointer (is the pointer on the stack?) to data on the heap.

> We call having references as function parameters borrowing. As in real life, if a person owns something, you can borrow it from them. When youâ€™re done, you have to give it back.

- in the above, a *reference* to `s1` is passed into `calculate_length`, instead of the pointer itself.
- the ampersand begins with 'a', so does address (pneumonic device)
- or you can think of the `&` as a mask that one variable wears of another variable

## Referencing

- Aside: the opposite of referencing is dereferencing, with `*` (discussed in Chapter 8)

```rust
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

```

- `len` does not OWN the value of `s1`
- so when `len` goes out of scope, nothing happens to the owner of the `&s1` value passed into it.
- `calculate_length` only *borrows* the value of `s1` by using `&s1` as a reference

## Mutable References

### Right âœ…

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello"); // assigned as mutable with `mut`

    change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

### WRONG ðŸš«

```rust
fn main() {
    // this is not marked `mut`
    let s = String::from("hello");

    change(&s); // boom boom uh oh
}

fn change(some_string: &String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

> But mutable references have one big restriction: you can only have one mutable reference to a particular piece of data in a particular scope. This code will fail:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &mut s;
let r2 = &mut s;
```

Hereâ€™s the error:

```bash
error[E0499]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time
 --> borrow_twice.rs:5:19
  |
4 |     let r1 = &mut s;
  |                   - first mutable borrow occurs here
5 |     let r2 = &mut s;
  |                   ^ second mutable borrow occurs here
6 | }
  | - first borrow ends here
  ```

- what if `r1` and `r2` independently mutate the value of `s`? whose change will be final?

### Data Race

A *data race* is similar to race conditions, and happens when these three conditions occur:

- Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
- At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.
- Thereâ€™s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.

> Data races cause undefined behavior and can be difficult to diagnose and fix when youâ€™re trying to track them down at runtime; Rust prevents this problem from happening because it wonâ€™t even compile code with data races!

> As always, we can use curly brackets to create a new scope, allowing for multiple mutable references, just not simultaneous ones:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

{
    let r1 = &mut s;
    println!("{}", r1); // hello
    r1.push_str(" wut");

} // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.

let r2 = &mut s;

println!("{}", r2); // hello wut
```

> A similar rule exists for combining mutable and immutable references. This code results in an error:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &s; // no problem
let r2 = &s; // no problem, it's just a silly double reference.
// It's like hearing two hypothetical stories with the same initial value, no problem

let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM
```

Hereâ€™s the error:

```bash
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
 --> borrow_thrice.rs:6:19
  |
4 |     let r1 = &s; // no problem
  |               - immutable borrow occurs here
5 |     let r2 = &s; // no problem
6 |     let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM
  |                   ^ mutable borrow occurs here
7 | }
  | - immutable borrow ends here
```

- having both an immutable *and* mutable reference in the same scope is not allowed.
- **but having multiple immutable references is okay**

### Dangling References

> In languages with pointers, itâ€™s easy to erroneously create a dangling pointer, a pointer that references a location in memory that may have been given to someone else, by freeing some memory while preserving a pointer to that memory. In Rust, by contrast, the compiler guarantees that references will never be dangling references: **if you have a reference to some data, the compiler will ensure that the data will not go out of scope before the reference to the data does.**

Letâ€™s try to create a dangling reference, which Rust will prevent with a compile-time error:

```rust
fn main() {
    let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
}

fn dangle() -> &String {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    &s
}
```

Hereâ€™s the error:

```
error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
 --> dangle.rs:5:16
  |
5 | fn dangle() -> &String {
  |                ^ expected lifetime parameter
  |
  = help: this function's return type contains a borrowed value, but there is
  no value for it to be borrowed from
  = help: consider giving it a 'static lifetime
```

> This error message refers to a feature we havenâ€™t covered yet: lifetimes. Weâ€™ll discuss lifetimes in detail in Chapter 10. But, if you disregard the parts about lifetimes, the message does contain the key to why this code is a problem:


> This function's return type contains a borrowed value, but there is no value for it to be borrowed from. Letâ€™s take a closer look at exactly whatâ€™s happening at each stage of our dangle code:

```rust
fn dangle() -> &String { // dangle returns a reference to a String

    let s = String::from("hello"); // s is a new String

    &s // we return a reference to the String, s
} // Here, s goes out of scope, and is dropped. Its memory goes away.
  // Danger!
```

>Because `s` is created inside `dangle`, when the code of `dangle` is finished, `s` will be deallocated. But we tried to return a reference to it. That means this reference would be pointing to an invalid String. Thatâ€™s no good! Rust wonâ€™t let us do this.

The solution here is to return the String directly:

```rust
fn no_dangle() -> String {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    s
}
```

This works without any problems. Ownership is moved out, and nothing is deallocated.

### The Rules of References

Letâ€™s recap what weâ€™ve discussed about references:

- At any given time, you can have either (but not both of) one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
- References must always be valid. ie, they cannot point to expired data

Next, weâ€™ll look at a different kind of reference: slices.
