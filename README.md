These are my personal notes on "the book" about Rust.

initially from: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/2018-edition/,  

..then moved to more current version: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html.

> This version of the text assumes youâ€™re using Rust 1.37.0 or later with edition="2018" in Cargo.toml of all projects to use Rust 2018 Edition idioms.
