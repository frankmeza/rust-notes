# Using `Box<T>` to Point to Data on the Heap

The simplest smart pointer is a box, `Box<T>`

- it allows you to store data on the heap, instead of the stack. The stack will maintain a pointer to the actual data on the heap.  

`Box<T>` is used when:

1. you have a type whose size canâ€™t be known at compile time, and you want to use a value of that type in a context that requires an exact size. 

- This is explained in `"Enabling Recursive Types with Boxes"`.

2. you have a large amount of data and you want to transfer ownership, but ensure the data wonâ€™t be copied when you do so

Â¡hahÃ¡! ^^

- (this is the guts of the operation) Transferring ownership of a large amount of data can take a long time because the data is copied around on the stack. To improve performance in this situation, we can store the large amount of data on the heap in a box. Then, only the small amount of pointer data is copied around on the stack, while the data it references stays in one place on the heap. 

3. you want to own a value and you care only that itâ€™s a type that implements a particular trait rather than being of a specific type  

- The third case is known as a trait object, discussed in Chapter 17

## Using a `Box<T>` to Store Data on the Heap

```rust
fn main() {
    // the value of `b` is stored on the heap
    let b = Box::new(5);
    println!("b = {}", b);
}
```

We define the variable `b` to have the value of a Box that points to the value `5`, which is allocated on the heap. This program will print `b = 5`; in this case, we can access the data in the box similar to how we would if this data were on the stack. Just like any owned value, when a box goes out of scope, as `b` does at the end of main, it will be deallocated. The deallocation happens for the box (stored on the stack) and the data it points to (stored on the heap).

#### Letâ€™s look at a case where boxes allow us to define types that we wouldnâ€™t be allowed to if we didnâ€™t have boxes.

### Enabling Recursive Types with Boxes

At compile time, a recursive type's size cannot be known although Rust needs to know how much space a type takes up. This is because a recursive type can have a value that has as part of itself another value of the same type. Because this nesting of values could theoretically continue infinitely, Rust doesnâ€™t know how much space a value of a recursive type needs. However, boxes have a known size, so by inserting a box in a recursive type definition, you can have recursive types.

Letâ€™s explore the `cons` list, which is a data type common in functional programming languages, as an example of a recursive type. The `cons` list type weâ€™ll define is straightforward except for the recursion; therefore, the concepts in the example weâ€™ll work with will be useful any time you get into more complex situations involving recursive types.  

### More Information About the `Cons` List

- A `cons` list is a data structure from the Lisp programming language and its dialects. 
- In Lisp, the cons function (short for "construct function") constructs a new pair from its two arguments, which usually are a single value and another pair. These pairs containing pairs form a list.  
- "to cons x onto y" informally means to construct a new container instance by putting the element x at the start of this new container, followed by the container y.


- Each item in a `cons` list contains two elements: the value of the current item and the next item. The last item in the list contains only a value called Nil without a next item. 
- A `cons` list is produced by recursively calling the `cons` function. The canonical name to denote the base case of the recursion is Nil, which is different from the concept of `null` discussed in Chapter 6.
- The `cons` list isnâ€™t a commonly used data structure in Rust. Most of the time when you have a list of items in Rust, Vec<T> is a better choice to use. 
- Other, more complex recursive data types are useful in various situations, but by starting with the `cons` list, we can explore how boxes let us define a recursive data type without much distraction.

```rust
// This code does not compile!
enum List {
    Cons(i32, List),
    Nil,
}
```

Note: Weâ€™re implementing a cons list that holds only i32 values for the purposes of this example. We could have implemented it using generics, as we discussed in Chapter 10, to define a cons list type that could store values of any type.

Using the List type to store the list 1, 2, 3 would look like the code in Listing 15-3:

```rust
// This code does not compile!
use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};

fn main() {
    let list = Cons(1, Cons(2, Cons(3, Nil)));
}
```

- The first `Cons` value holds 1 and another List value. This List value is another `Cons` value that holds 2 and another List value. 
- This List value is one more `Cons` value that holds 3 and a List value, which is finally Nil, the non-recursive variant that signals the end of the list.

#### The error we get when attempting to define a recursive enum

```bash
error[E0072]: recursive type `List` has infinite size
 --> src/main.rs:1:1
  |
1 | enum List {
  | ^^^^^^^^^ recursive type has infinite size
2 |     Cons(i32, List),
  |               ----- recursive without indirection
  |
  = help: insert indirection (e.g., a `Box`, `Rc`, or `&`) at some point to
  make `List` representable
```

The error shows this type "has infinite size." The reason is that weâ€™ve defined List with a variant that is recursive: it holds another value of itself directly. As a result, Rust canâ€™t figure out how much space it needs to store a List value. Letâ€™s break down why we get this error a bit. First, letâ€™s look at how Rust decides how much space it needs to store a value of a non-recursive type.  

### Computing the Size of a Non-Recursive Type

Remember this enum from chapter 6?

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}
```

To determine how much space to allocate for a `Message` value, Rust does this:

- goes through each of the variants to see which variant needs the most space
  - `Message::Quit` doesnâ€™t need any space, 
  - `Message::Move` needs enough space to store two i32 values, 
  - the most space a `Message` value needs is the space to store the largest variant.

Contrast this with how much space Rust decides a recursive type like the `List` enum.

- The compiler starts by looking at the `Cons` variant, which holds a value of type `i32` and a value of type `List`. Therefore, `Cons` needs an amount of space equal to the size of an `i32` plus the size of a `List`. To figure out how much memory the `List` type needs, the compiler looks at the variants, starting with the `Cons` variant. The `Cons` variant holds a value of type `i32` and a value of type `List`, and this process continues infinitely

### Using `Box<T>` to Get a Recursive Type with a Known Size

The Rust compiler needs to know how much space to allocate for recursively defined types, so the compiler gives the error in Listing 15-4, including this helpful suggestion:

```bash
  = help: insert indirection (e.g., a `Box`, `Rc`, or `&`) at some point to
  make `List` representable
```

> In this suggestion, "indirection" means that instead of storing a value directly, weâ€™ll change the data structure to store the value indirectly by storing a pointer to the value instead.

`Box<T>` is a pointer, so:

- Rust always knows how much space a `Box<T>` needs
- a pointerâ€™s size doesnâ€™t change based on the amount of data itâ€™s pointing to. 
  
This means we can put a `Box<T>` inside the `Cons` variant instead of another `List` value directly. The `Box<T>` will point to the next List value that will be on the heap rather than inside the `Cons` variant. 

- Conceptually this is still a list, created with lists "holding" other lists, but now more like placing the items next to one another rather than inside one another.

```rust
// this will compile ðŸ˜ƒ
enum List {
    Cons(i32, Box<List>),
    Nil,
}

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};

fn main() {
    let list = Cons(1,
        Box::new(Cons(2,
            Box::new(Cons(3,
                Box::new(Nil))))));
}
```

The `Cons` variant will need the size of an `i32` plus the space to store the boxâ€™s pointer data. The `Nil` variant stores no values, so it needs less space than the `Cons` variant. We now know that any List value will take up the size of an `i32` plus the size of a boxâ€™s pointer data. By using a box, weâ€™ve broken the infinite, recursive chain, so the compiler can figure out the size it needs to store a List value __on the heap__, explicitly.

### A finite `Cons` list

Boxes provide only the indirection and heap allocation

- they donâ€™t have any other special capabilities, like the other smart pointer types. 
- They also donâ€™t have any performance overhead that these special capabilities incur, so they can be useful in cases like the cons list where the indirection is the only feature we need. Weâ€™ll look at more use cases for boxes in Chapter 17, too.

The `Box<T>` type is a smart pointer because it implements the `Deref` trait, which allows `Box<T>` values to be treated like references. When a `Box<T>` value goes out of scope, the heap data that the box is pointing to is cleaned up as well because of the `Drop` trait implementation. Letâ€™s explore these two traits in more detail. These two traits will be even more important to the functionality provided by the other smart pointer types weâ€™ll discuss in the rest of this chapter.
