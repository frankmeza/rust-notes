# Closures: Anonymous Functions that Can Capture Their Environment

- Rust's closures allow you to access and capture the variables in one scope from another scope. They can be created in one place and then used elsewhere

## Creating an Abstraction of Behavior with Closures

### A Hypothetical Expensive Calculation

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn simulated_expensive_calc(intensity: u32) -> u32 {
    println!("calculating slowly...");
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
    intensity
}
fn generate_workout(intensity: u32, random_number: u32) {
    if intensity < 25 {
        println!(
            "Today, do {} pushups!",
            simulated_expensive_calculation(intensity)
        );
        println!(
            "Next, do {} situps!",
            simulated_expensive_calculation(intensity)
        );
    } else {
        if random_number == 3 {
            println!("Take a break today! Remember to stay hydrated!");
        } else {
            println!(
                "Today, run for {} minutes!",
                simulated_expensive_calculation(intensity)
            );
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let simulated_user_specified_value = 10;
    let simulated_random_number = 7;

    generate_workout(
        simulated_user_specified_value ,
        simulated_random_number,
    );
}
```

- `simulated_expensive_calculation` is in too many places...

## Refactoring Using Functions

- the result of the `simulated_expensive_calculation` can be stored in a variable at the top of the fn body, and then the results can be passed into the active arm of the code

## Refactoring with Closures to Store Code

```rust
let expensive_closure = |num| {
    println!("calculating slowly..");
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
    num
}
```

A closure:  

- encapsolates behavior itself, instead of a value. 
- This is how similar behavior can be spread across different scopes. 
- It is a function whose parts have distinct relationships to each other, and has shared behavior with nearby code which could be encapsulated with a variable. 
- It's clean looking though  

After seeing this comparison:

```rust
fn  add_one_v1   (x: u32) -> u32 { x + 1 }
let add_one_v2 = |x: u32| -> u32 { x + 1 };
let add_one_v3 = |x|             { x + 1 };
let add_one_v4 = |x|               x + 1  ;
```

it almost appears as if closures are a kind of _dialect_ of functions.  

The second one, 

```rust
let add_one_v2 = |x: u32| -> u32 { x + 1 };
```

looks just like

```typescript
const addOneV2 = (n: number): number => { n + 1 }
```

## Closure Type Inference and Annotation

Closures do not require to be typed, like other functions. Closures are not public facing. However, in the pursuit of explicitness and strictness, a closure with annotations like `add_one_f2`

```rust
let expensive_closure = |num: u32| -> u32 {
    println!("calculating slowly...");
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
    num
};
```

- say that a `String` first enters the closure and walks out without error, the next `i32` will not compile. Not cool, dude. Blame the compiler inferrence. It locks its first data type as the unique one used within that closure.  

## Storing Closures Using Generic Parameters and the Fn Traits

### reread this 

### My Own Thoughts About It All, After The First Read

__It's a struct that holds a closure, so that it can be passed around instead of the closure itself__

__It's like a JS object that has a function on it as part of a key/value pair__

__It's like a pointer to a function...???...!!!...???__

__"I'm going to give you this function that I'm going to run inside of your function, so that you can give me the variables that I need to run my function."__

In Rust, a `struct` can be created to hold the closure. In order to do that, a type must be specified for the closure to give to the `struct`.  

> Each closure instance has its own unique anonymous type: that is, even if two closures have the same signature, their types are still considered different. To define structs, enums, or function parameters that use closures, we use generics and trait bounds, as we discussed in Chapter 10.

- wut ^^

All closures implement at least one of the following:

- `Fn`
- `FnMut`
- `FnOnce`

```rust
// struct Cacher over a generic type, where 
// that type implements fn signature `Fn :: u32 -> u32`
struct Cacher<T>
    where T: Fn(u32) -> u32 // 2. the trait bound on T is that of a closure (Fn, FnMut, FnOnce)
{
    calculation: T, // 1. the calc field of the generic type T
    value: Option<u32>,
}
```

1. The Cacher struct has a calculation field of the generic type T. 
2. The trait bounds on T specify that itâ€™s a closure by using the Fn trait.
3. |When in Use, not in definition| -> Any closure we want to store in the calculation field must have 
  * one u32 parameter (in parens) and must return a u32 (after ->).


```rust
impl<T> Cacher<T>
    where T: Fn(u32) -> u32
{
    fn new(calculation: T) -> Cacher<T> {
        Cacher {
            calculation,
            value: None, // 1. Option<u32>, but 2. right now None
        }
    }

    fn value(&mut self, arg: u32) -> u32 {
        match self.value {
            None => {
                let v = (self.calculation)(arg); // 3. value is set
                self.value = Some(v);
                v
            },
            Some(v) => v, // 4. value is returned if already set
        }
    }
}
```

1. The value field is of type Option<u32>.
2. Before we execute the closure, value will be None. 
3. When code using a Cacher asks for the result of the closure, the Cacher will execute the closure at that time and store the result within a Some variant in the value field. 
4. Then if the code asks for the result of the closure again, instead of executing the closure again, the Cacher will return the result held in the Some variant.
